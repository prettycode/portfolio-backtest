A tool for evaluating composition of global asset classes.

Issues with Portfolio Visualizer:

1. ✅ Cannot backtest more than three portfolios at a time
2. ✅ Cannot create a portfolio that is both a mix of asset classes and assets
3. ✅ Cannot create a portfolio that includes a custom portfolio as an allocation
4. ❌ Backtest tickers must be manually defined
5. ✅ Does not calculate the develered composition of a leveraged portfolio
6. ❌ Price history does not go as far back as Simba's Spreadsheet
7. ❌ Cannot save a portfolio directly from the portfolio backtest page
8. ✅ Asset Class backtesting does not support margin (i.e. CASHX)
9. ❌ ETFs for asset classes (e.g. VGIT, VTI) do not automatically backfill with asset class history

TODO:

1. Load comparison
2. Disable row/column
3. Delete row/column
4. Form validation
