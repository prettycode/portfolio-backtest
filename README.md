A tool for customizing and evaluating portfolios of asset classes.

Portfolio Visualizer shortcomings:

1. ✅ Cannot backtest more than three portfolios at a time
2. ✅ Cannot create a portfolio that is both a mix of assets and asset classes
3. ✅ Cannot create a portfolio that includes a custom portfolio as an allocation
4. ❌ Backtest tickers must be manually defined
5. ✅ Does not calculate the develered composition of a leveraged portfolio
6. ❌ Price history does not go as far back as Simba's Spreadsheet
7. ❌ Cannot save a portfolio directly from the portfolio backtest page
8. ✅ "Backtest Portfolio Asset Class Allocation" does not support margin (i.e. CASHX)
9. ❌ ETFs for asset classes (e.g. VGIT, VTI) do not automatically backfill with asset class history

## TO-DO:

1. Disable row/column
2. Delete row/column
3. Form validation
4. Name custom portfolio (e.g. give names to P1, P2, etc.)
5. Menu for custom portfolios (e.g. dropdown menu for P1, P2, etc. that allows: loading, saving, clearing, copying, equal-weight)
6. Indexes on funds (i.e. EDV corresponds to Bloomberge XYZ Index)
7. Sythentic vs. Custom (synthetic: default/all-user customs; custom: private, user-level customs)
