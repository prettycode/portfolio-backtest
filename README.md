A tool for evaluating portfolio composition.

Issues with Portfolio Visualizer:

1. Cannot backtest more than three portfolios at a time
2. Cannot create a portfolio that is both a mix of asset classes and assets
3. Cannot create a portfolio that includes a custom portfolio as an allocation
4. Backtest tickers must be manually defined
5. Does not calculate the develered composition of a leveraged portfolio
6. Price history does not go as far back as Simba's Spreadsheet
